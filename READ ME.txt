#Credit Card Fraud Detection - Machine Learning Project

A machine learning project that detects fraudulent transactions using the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset. The data is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of transactions being fraudulent — making this an ideal case for anomaly detection techniques.

---

## Overview

**Goal**: Build a classification model that accurately identifies fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Techniques Used**:
- Data cleaning & EDA
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Handling class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Training models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluating model performance using **ROC-AUC**, **confusion matrix**, and **precision-recall**

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- matplotlib & seaborn
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for nulls, duplicates
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (`Time`, `Amount` after scaling)

2. **Feature Scaling**
   - Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize the `Amount` column

3. **Class Imbalance Handling**
   - Applied **SMOTE** to balance the dataset

4. **Model Training**
   - Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score

## Results

| Model               | ROC-AUC Score |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.96 (approx) |
| Random Forest       | 0.98 (approx) |

ROC Curve and confusion matrix visuals are in the `visuals/` folder.
